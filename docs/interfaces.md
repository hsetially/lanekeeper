# Interfaces

Prompt 01 creates these in `crates/ports`, with types from `crates/domain`. They are the seams between workstreams. Agents implement or consume them exactly as written. Changes go through a contract-change PR.

## Conventions

- Object-safe async traits use `#[async_trait]`. All traits are `Send + Sync + 'static`.
- Every port has an in-memory fake in `crates/ports/src/fakes/`, behind the `fakes` feature. Tests in other crates use these fakes, never a sibling crate's real implementation.
- Errors are per-port `thiserror` enums.
- Timeouts are passed in explicitly. Nothing waits indefinitely.
- `Bytes` means `bytes::Bytes`.

The signatures below show the shape. Exact generic details are settled in prompt 01.

## Platform ports (implemented by 03b)

```rust
#[async_trait] pub trait AgentGateway {
    /// Routed to whichever replica holds the agent's stream.
    async fn request(&self, s: &SwimlaneId, cmd: HubCommand, timeout: Duration)
        -> Result<AgentReply, GatewayError>;
    async fn status(&self, s: &SwimlaneId) -> AgentStatus;
}

#[async_trait] pub trait ReportSink {               // implemented by 05
    async fn hello(&self, id: &AgentIdentity, h: Hello) -> Result<AgentConfig, SinkError>;
    async fn heartbeat(&self, id: &AgentIdentity, hb: Heartbeat) -> Result<HeartbeatAction, SinkError>;
    async fn delta(&self, id: &AgentIdentity, d: ScanDelta) -> Result<(), SinkError>;
    async fn cluster(&self, id: &AgentIdentity, c: ClusterReport) -> Result<(), SinkError>;
}

#[async_trait] pub trait BlobStore {
    async fn put(&self, bytes: Bytes) -> Result<ContentHash, BlobError>;   // idempotent
    async fn get(&self, h: &ContentHash) -> Result<Option<Bytes>, BlobError>; // cached
    async fn get_many(&self, hs: &[ContentHash]) -> Result<Vec<(ContentHash, Bytes)>, BlobError>;
}

pub trait GitReader {                                    // sync; call via spawn_blocking
    fn head(&self, r: RepoKind, branch: &str) -> Result<CommitId, GitError>;
    fn branches(&self, r: RepoKind) -> Result<Vec<BranchInfo>, GitError>;
    fn tags(&self, r: RepoKind) -> Result<Vec<TagInfo>, GitError>;
    fn tree_index(&self, r: RepoKind, c: &CommitId) -> Result<Arc<TreeIndex>, GitError>;
    fn diff_trees(&self, r: RepoKind, from: &CommitId, to: &CommitId) -> Result<Vec<PathChange>, GitError>;
    fn read(&self, r: RepoKind, c: &CommitId, path: &RepoPath) -> Result<Option<Bytes>, GitError>;
    fn history(&self, r: RepoKind, branch: &str, path: &RepoPath, limit: usize) -> Result<Vec<CommitInfo>, GitError>;
    fn describe(&self, r: RepoKind, c: &CommitId) -> Result<VersionLabel, GitError>;
}

#[async_trait] pub trait EventBus {
    async fn publish(&self, e: DomainEvent) -> Result<(), BusError>;  // fans out across replicas
    fn subscribe(&self, f: EventFilter) -> BoxStream<'static, DomainEvent>; // bounded; lag => Resync
}

#[async_trait] pub trait Leases {
    async fn try_acquire(&self, name: &str, ttl: Duration) -> Result<Option<LeaseGuard>, LeaseError>;
}

#[async_trait] pub trait KmsSigner {
    async fn sign_digest(&self, key: KeyRef, digest: [u8; 32]) -> Result<Signature, KmsError>;
}

#[async_trait] pub trait KmsEnvelope {
    async fn wrap(&self, dek: &Secret<[u8; 32]>, aad: &[u8]) -> Result<WrappedKey, KmsError>;
    async fn unwrap(&self, w: &WrappedKey, aad: &[u8]) -> Result<Secret<[u8; 32]>, KmsError>;
}

#[async_trait] pub trait SecretSource {
    async fn get(&self, name: &str) -> Result<Secret<String>, SecretError>;
}

#[async_trait] pub trait Notifier {
    async fn notify(&self, n: Notification) -> Result<(), NotifyError>; // never fails the caller's action
}
```

## Identity ports (implemented by 03a)

```rust
#[async_trait] pub trait TokenVerifier {
    async fn entra_access_token(&self, jwt: &str) -> Result<VerifiedUser, AuthError>;  // MCP
    async fn google_id_token(&self, jwt: &str, aud: &str) -> Result<GoogleIdentity, AuthError>; // agent join
}

#[async_trait] pub trait Users {
    async fn get(&self, id: &UserId) -> Result<Option<User>, UserError>;
    async fn require_active(&self, id: &UserId, min: Role) -> Result<User, AuthError>;
}

#[async_trait] pub trait AuditLog {
    async fn record(&self, tx: &mut Tx<'_>, e: AuditEvent) -> Result<AuditId, AuditError>; // chained
    async fn record_many(&self, tx: &mut Tx<'_>, events: Vec<AuditEvent>) -> Result<Vec<AuditId>, AuditError>; // chained, batched
}
```

`AuditLog::record_many` (additive, P15; it has a default that calls `record` once per event, so an implementation that does not override it keeps working):

- **Same chain.** It writes exactly the chain that one `record` call per event writes: one entry per event (rule 8 is unchanged), the same links and hashes, the same checks per event. The ids come back in input order, and they are the entries' ids.
- **Ordering.** The events are chained in input order, and the batch is consecutive in the chain: another writer's entry never falls inside it, because the chain lock is held from the batch to the end of the caller's transaction. Calls of `record` and `record_many` interleave freely, in one transaction and across transactions, into one valid chain.
- **Atomic with the transaction.** The entries exist only if `tx` commits. A rollback leaves no entry and no chain advance: the next entry chains to the old head.
- **Size.** At most `MAX_AUDIT_BATCH` (200) events. A bigger batch is refused whole with `AuditError::BatchTooLarge`, never truncated, and nothing is recorded. 200 is four times the 50 versions of one agent message, the largest unit that audits many paths in one transaction (D93), and it bounds how long the chain lock is held for one call (the batch is one statement of at most 200 events of at most 64 KiB each; the real log writes 200 typical events in about 12 ms and 50 in about 4 ms, against 104 ms and 22 ms for one `record` call per event). An empty batch is `Ok` with no ids; it takes no lock and does not look at `tx`.
- **Failure.** An event that `record` would refuse (`TooLarge`, `Encode`) is refused the same way before anything of the batch is recorded: the transaction stays usable, and committing it keeps nothing of the batch. Any other error (`Unavailable`: the lock timed out, the store failed) leaves the transaction in an unknown state, so the caller rolls back, as after a failed `record`.
- **Call it last,** like `record`: the lock is held until the transaction ends.

## Domain services (implemented by 05, 06 and 14; used by REST and MCP)

```rust
#[async_trait] pub trait RegistryRead {
    async fn swimlanes(&self, u: &User) -> Result<Vec<SwimlaneSummary>, ReadError>;
    async fn tree(&self, u: &User, s: &SwimlaneId, prefix: &NfsPath, page: Page) -> Result<Paged<FileEntry>, ReadError>;
    async fn content(&self, u: &User, s: &SwimlaneId, p: &NfsPath, src: ContentSource) -> Result<FileContent, ReadError>;
    async fn history(&self, u: &User, s: &SwimlaneId, p: &NfsPath, page: Page) -> Result<Paged<Version>, ReadError>;
    async fn compare(&self, u: &User, l: CompareRef, r: CompareRef, p: Option<LogicalFile>) -> Result<Comparison, ReadError>;
    async fn compare_tree(&self, u: &User, l: CompareRef, r: CompareRef, page: Page) -> Result<TreeComparison, ReadError>;
    async fn grid(&self, u: &User, q: GridQuery) -> Result<Grid, ReadError>;
    async fn search_settings(&self, u: &User, q: SettingsQuery) -> Result<Paged<SettingHit>, ReadError>;
    async fn search_text(&self, u: &User, q: TextQuery) -> Result<TextResults, ReadError>;
    async fn findings(&self, u: &User, q: FindingsQuery) -> Result<Paged<Finding>, ReadError>;
    async fn effective(&self, u: &User, s: &SwimlaneId, f: &LogicalFile) -> Result<EffectiveConfig, ReadError>;
    async fn pending_restarts(&self, u: &User, s: &SwimlaneId) -> Result<Vec<ServiceState>, ReadError>;
}

#[async_trait] pub trait WriteService {
    async fn edit(&self, ctx: &WriteCtx, r: EditRequest) -> Result<WriteOutcome, WriteError>;
    async fn upload(&self, ctx: &WriteCtx, r: UploadRequest) -> Result<WriteOutcome, WriteError>;
    async fn delete(&self, ctx: &WriteCtx, r: DeleteRequest) -> Result<WriteOutcome, WriteError>;
    async fn revert(&self, ctx: &WriteCtx, r: RevertRequest) -> Result<WriteOutcome, WriteError>;
    async fn restart(&self, ctx: &WriteCtx, r: RestartRequest) -> Result<WriteOutcome, WriteError>;
    async fn raise_pr(&self, ctx: &WriteCtx, r: PrRequest) -> Result<WriteOutcome, WriteError>;
    async fn propose_draft(&self, ctx: &WriteCtx, r: EditRequest) -> Result<Draft, WriteError>; // no side effects
    async fn apply_draft(&self, ctx: &WriteCtx, id: DraftId) -> Result<WriteOutcome, WriteError>;
}
// WriteCtx carries the user, via (Ui | Mcp), an idempotency key and a request id.
// WriteOutcome is one of Applied, ProposalCreated, Conflict{current}, Locked or Rejected{reason}.

#[async_trait] pub trait DocSearch {
    async fn search(&self, u: &User, q: &str, limit: usize) -> Result<Vec<DocHit>, DocError>;
    async fn related(&self, u: &User, f: &LogicalFile) -> Result<Vec<DocHit>, DocError>;
    async fn read(&self, u: &User, path: &DocPath, lines: Option<LineRange>) -> Result<DocText, DocError>;
    async fn grep(&self, u: &User, pattern: &str, regex: bool, context: u8) -> Result<Vec<DocGrepHit>, DocError>;
    async fn feature_status(&self, u: &User, q: FeatureQuery) -> Result<FeatureStatus, DocError>;
}
```

## Domain events

Published on the `EventBus`, and delivered to SSE subscribers filtered by what each user can see.

```rust
enum DomainEvent {
    FileObserved { swimlane, path, hash, source },        // scan | tool_write | sync
    DriftChanged { swimlane, paths },
    FindingsChanged { swimlane },
    PendingRestartChanged { swimlane, services },         // superseded by PickupChanged (D85); kept, no longer published once 05 has pickup state
    ProposalChanged { id, status },
    AgentStatusChanged { swimlane, status },
    GitHeadMoved { repo, branch, from, to },
    AccessRequestCreated { user },
    DocIndexed { doc },
    Resync,                                               // the subscriber lagged; refetch state
}
```

## Engine API (04, pure functions)

- `classify`
- `parse` and `validate`
- `flatten`
- `index_settings`, which returns setting rows with their line ranges
- `locate`
- `map_path` and `reverse_map`
- `effective`
- `effective_tree_hash`
- `drift_state`
- `text_diff`, `semantic_diff` and `binary_compare`
- `grid`
- `search_text`
- `checks_c1_to_c8`
- `effect_preview`
- `secret_scan`
- `apply_eol` and `normalise_eol`
- `version_label`
- batch variants that use rayon internally

The batch functions must be called from a blocking context.

## Additions (D72–D80)

```rust
// EventBus gains outbox publishing (D80); plain publish() remains, for events with no database change.
#[async_trait] pub trait EventBus {
    async fn publish_in_tx(&self, tx: &mut Tx<'_>, e: DomainEvent) -> Result<(), BusError>; // fanned out after commit
    async fn publish_many_in_tx(&self, tx: &mut Tx<'_>, events: Vec<DomainEvent>) -> Result<(), BusError>; // the same, batched
    // ...existing methods
}

#[async_trait] pub trait SentinelSink {                    // implemented by 05
    async fn hello(&self, id: &SentinelIdentity, h: SentinelHello) -> Result<SentinelConfig, SinkError>;
    async fn records(&self, id: &SentinelIdentity, batch: AuditRecordBatch) -> Result<AckSeq, SinkError>;
}

pub struct Attribution { source: AttributionSource, confidence: Confidence, actor: Option<Actor>, evidence: Evidence }
// The engine gains severity(&ChangeContext, &[SeverityRule]) -> Severity, and inline change ranges in diff hunks.
```

`EventBus::publish_many_in_tx` (additive, P15; it has a default that calls `publish_in_tx` once per event):

- **Same events.** Each event of the batch gets what `publish_in_tx` gives it: the same payload bound (the outbox bus stores an event over its size cap as a `Resync` at its place, and counts it), the same filters and swimlane rule for its subscribers (internal events included), fan-out only after the commit and never on a rollback, and at-least-once delivery.
- **Ordering.** The events of a batch take outbox positions in input order, and in order with the other `publish_in_tx` and `publish_many_in_tx` calls of the same transaction. The outbox bus writes a batch with one statement, so its ids are consecutive unless another session draws ids in the same instant; the relay's rule for rows that commit after a higher id was read (`events::relay`) applies to a batch as to any rows.
- **Atomic with the transaction,** as `publish_in_tx`: parked until the commit, gone on a rollback.
- **Size.** At most `MAX_EVENT_BATCH` (200) events; a bigger batch is `BusError::BatchTooLarge`, refused whole, nothing published. An empty batch is `Ok`, writes nothing and does not look at `tx`. On any other error the caller rolls back, as after a failed `publish_in_tx`; a batch refused before it is written (too many, or a transaction of another store) writes none of it.

New domain events:

- `AttributionUpdated { swimlane, path, hash }`
- `PrStateChanged { link_id, state }`
- `PrJobProgress { job_id, state }`
- `SyncWindowOpened { swimlane, job }`
- `SyncWindowClosed { swimlane, job }`
- `UserSessionsRevoked { user }`: internal, for replica coordination (03a). `DomainEvent::is_internal()` is true for it; the SSE edge drops it, and it is not in the OpenAPI `EventKind` list.
- `PickupChanged { swimlane, services }`: D85 (prompt 05). The pickup state of a change changed for these services; it carries ids only, and the state itself (with "live by HH:MM") is read from the pending-restarts endpoint. It supersedes `PendingRestartChanged`, which stays in the contract so that old rows and subscribers still parse. In the OpenAPI `EventKind` as `pickup_changed`.
